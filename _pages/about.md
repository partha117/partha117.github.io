I am a Deep Learning Researcher at Huawei Canada, specializing in Vision-Language models within the AI-Generated Content Group. My work focuses on building accurate and generalizable Multi-Modal Language Models (MLLM) that seamlessly integrate visual and textual understanding for real-world applications.

Before this, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Waterloo, where I developed machine learning techniques to detect software bugs directly from source code. Using a combination of Reinforcement Learning and language modeling, I created AI-driven solutions to identify bugs/vulnerabilities with high precision.

I also worked as an Applied Scientist II Intern at Amazon Ads, focusing on ranking models and ad targeting. This involved optimizing models to enhance ad relevance and user engagement.

Research Interest
======
I am broadly interested in building applications using large language models (LLMs), multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), and vision-language models (VLMs), particularly in:

  * **Search & Ranking Systems** – Developing learning-to-rank models and optimizing multi-modal deep learning models for applications like search, recommendation, and ad personalization.
  * **Vision-Language & Multi-Modal AI** – Enhancing model performance for image-text understanding, instruction generation, and multi-modal reasoning using VLMs and MLLMs.
To learn more about my work, please check out my projects and relevant publications.
  * **Software Engineering & Bug Localization** – Applying LLMs and reinforcement learning for bug localization, software vulnerability detection, and ranking of source code files.

For more details about my work, please explore my projects and related publications.

      <b><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10587162" target="_blank">Revisiting the Performance of Deep Learning-Based Vulnerability Detection on Realistic Datasets</a></b>
      <br>We demonstrated that the performance of existing vulnerability detection models lacks generalizability due to a bias in the dataset curation pipeline. To address this issue, we proposed a new dataset curation technique and evaluated six different models, including CodeLlama and Mixtral. Our results show that models trained on the newly curated dataset exhibit a 30% improvement in generalization performance.
